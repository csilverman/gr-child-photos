# _layout-generics

This folder contains generic structures that can be applied to specific markup via @extend.

Example: A responsive 3-col grid. This could be applied to an archive page, or the front page of a blog, etc, simply by @extending it to target those selectors.

All Sass in this folder must target generic % selectors.
